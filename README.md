# Slugger Outfielder Placement Optimization Widget

This semester, I’ve worked as one of the SLUGGER widget developers under the SLUGGER platform team to create an Outfielder Optimization Widget. The project extracts Trackman-derived batted-ball data through the SLUGGER API to compute optimal defensive placements for each left field, center field, and right field. Grid-based optimization framework is used, inspired by Dr.D’s prior spreadsheet-based methods, to estimate outfielder positioning that minimizes expected run value given a hitter’s spray tendencies and parameters. The widget integrates backend data processing in Python with a web-based visualization interface, where positioning recommendations are overlaid on a ballpark field diagram. 



## Key Features

- Hitter-Specific Spray Charts
- Grid-Based Optimization Framework
- Interactive Web Interface



## Programs Used
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib
- API: SLUGGER API (Trackman-derived)
- Deployment: pythonanywhere
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the Repository
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
3. Install Dependencies
4. Set Environment Variables
5. Run the Application (app.py)


## Acknowledgements

This project was developed in collaboration with the SLUGGER platform team and is inspired by Excel-based defensive positioning workflows originally developed by Dr. D during his work with Major League Baseball.
